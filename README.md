Password Generator
The goal of this assignment was to create a password generator that asks users to choose a numer between 8-128.
Once the password length is registered users must then confirm what type of characters they want to use (Capital Letters, Lowercase Letters, Numbers, Symbols.)
After password length & character types are confirmed the user will be shown a unique password with the options they selected.
